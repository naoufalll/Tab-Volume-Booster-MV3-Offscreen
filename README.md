# Tab Volume Booster (MV3 Offscreen)

A Chrome extension built with Manifest V3 that allows you to control and boost the audio volume for individual browser tabs, even beyond the standard 100% limit, using the Offscreen API for efficient processing.

## Features

*   **Per-Tab Volume Control:** Adjust the volume independently for each tab.
*   **Volume Boosting:** Increase volume up to **600%**.
*   **Non-Linear Slider:** Provides finer control, especially at higher volume levels (curve configurable in `popup.js`).
*   **Preset Volume Levels:** Quickly set volume to common levels (50%, 100%, 200%, 400%, MAX) with dedicated buttons.
*   **Visual Feedback:** The volume percentage display briefly changes color upon successful setting.
*   **Active Tab List:** View a list of all tabs currently being boosted (volume â‰  100%) directly in the popup, including their favicons and current volume.
*   **Quick Reset:**
    *   Reset the *current* tab's volume back to 100%.
    *   Reset any boosted tab's volume directly from the active list.
*   **Navigation Persistence:** Volume settings for a tab are automatically reapplied when navigating within that same tab (e.g., clicking through videos on YouTube).
*   **Clipping Prevention:** Includes a built-in Web Audio Dynamics Compressor (limiter) to help prevent harsh audio clipping when boosting volume significantly.
*   **Efficient Resource Usage:** Leverages Chrome's Offscreen API to run audio processing only when needed, closing the offscreen document automatically when no tabs require volume adjustment.
*   **Clear Status & Errors:** Provides user-friendly status messages and error feedback in the popup UI.
*   **Manifest V3 Compliant:** Built using the modern Chrome extension platform.


## How to Use

1.  **Install** the extension.
2.  Navigate to a tab playing audio (e.g., a YouTube video, Spotify Web Player).
3.  **Click the extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar.
4.  The popup will show the current volume for that tab.
5.  **Adjust the Volume:**
    *   Use the **slider** for precise control.
    *   Click one of the **preset buttons** (50%, 100%, 200%, etc.) for quick changes.
6.  **View Boosted Tabs:** Scroll down in the popup to see a list of other tabs currently having their volume modified.
7.  **Reset Volume:**
    *   Click the **"Reset Current Tab"** button to set the active tab back to 100%.
    *   Click the **"Reset"** button next to a tab in the "Boosted Tabs" list to reset that specific tab's volume.

The volume setting for a tab will persist as long as the volume is not 100%, even if the audio is paused. It will also automatically re-apply after navigating within the same tab.

## Permissions Explained

This extension requires the following permissions:

*   **`tabs`**: Needed to query active tabs, get tab details (ID, URL, title, audible state, muted state) for the popup UI, list functionality, and applying changes.
*   **`tabCapture`**: Required to capture the audio stream from a specific tab using `chrome.tabCapture.getMediaStreamId`. This is essential for processing the audio.
*   **`offscreen`**: Required to create and manage an Offscreen Document. This document runs the Web Audio API graph to process the captured tab audio without needing a persistent background script or visible page.
*   **`storage`**: Used to store the volume settings for each tab (`chrome.storage.local`) so they persist between browser sessions and popup openings.
*   **`favicon`**: Used by the background script via `chrome.tabs.get` to retrieve favicon URLs for display in the "Boosted Tabs" list in the popup.
*   **`scripting`**: (Currently included but minimally used) Might be used for future features like injecting UI elements or more complex interactions.

We strive to use the minimum permissions necessary for the extension's functionality.

## Installation

**Manual Installation (For Development):**

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle switch in the top-right corner.
4.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
5.  Select the `tab-volume-booster` directory (the one containing `manifest.json`).
6.  The extension should now be loaded and visible in your toolbar.

## Known Limitations

*   **Cannot Control `chrome://` Pages:** Chrome extensions cannot interact with internal browser pages for security reasons.
*   **Initial Capture Delay:** While minimized, there might be a very brief moment when starting playback on a boosted tab where the audio starts before the boost is fully applied (though mitigations are in place).
*   **Resource Usage:** While the Offscreen API is efficient, having a very large number of tabs actively boosted simultaneously *might* still consume noticeable system resources (CPU/Memory). The limiter helps prevent extreme audio issues, but quality might depend on the source audio and boost level.
